# How to run locally

You either need NPM (Node) or Docker.

## NPM

- Make sure to install NPM and Node on your machine.
- Clone the repository and CD into the root directory.
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
- To start the application, run `node app.js` in the root directory.
- Visit http://localhost:8080

## Troubleshooting

- If you get an error saying port 80 is already in use, try another port on your machine, like 4937.
